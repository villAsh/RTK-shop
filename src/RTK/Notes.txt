->Redux toolkit recommends that we should group together the reducer logic
    and actions for a single features in a single file.
->That file should contain slice as suffix,
->now to use slice import createslice method from redux toolkit.
SLICE::
->slice is a function which takes an object which contains 3 properties
1)name :
2)initial_state :
3)reducers :
->within the reducers we specify individual state transmissions
->within reducers we specify property which is a function and takes state and action 
  as an arguments.
->We can directly mutate the state in redux-toolkit because of immer library.

**createsilce will autometically generates action creators with the same
  name as the reducer functions we have written.
**apart from this it also return main reducer function which we have written.

->after creating a slice,
*use default export to export reducers.
*and use name export for actions.

STORE::
->store which stores the global state or data of our app.
->to create a rtk store we need to import configurestore from redux-toolkit.
->then asign to a variable and invoke the function configurestore which takes object
  as an argument,inside it we define a key 'reducer' which specify all the reducer slices 
  that belong to features.
